# Amazon Product Recommendation Model

## **Problem Statement**
Building a recommendation system for products on an e-commerce website like Amazon.com.

## **Description**
Online e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart use advanced recommendation models to provide tailored suggestions to their users. Amazon employs item-to-item collaborative filtering, a method that scales effectively with massive datasets and delivers high-quality recommendations in real time. 

This filtering approach matches each userâ€™s purchased and rated items with similar items and combines them into a personalized recommendation list. In this project, we focus on creating a recommendation system specifically for electronics products available on Amazon.

## **Features and Benefits**
- **Personalized Suggestions:** Delivers recommendations based on user preferences and purchase history.
- **Scalable Solution:** Capable of handling large datasets, making it suitable for real-world e-commerce platforms.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Encourages user engagement by presenting relevant product options.
- **Data-Driven Recommendations:** Uses collaborative filtering to generate insights into customer behavior.

## **Dataset**
The dataset utilized for this project is sourced from the Amazon Reviews Data repository.

## **Summary**
This project highlights how recommendation systems can transform user experiences and drive sales by connecting customers with the products they are most likely to enjoy.
